      <li>Foggintor was originally a tor - a typical hill on Dartmoor.</li> 
      <li> Foggintor Quarry opened in the early 1800's, with a few outbuildings to house workers and process the granite.</li>
      <li>There is speculation, but insuffcient evidence, that stone from Fogggintor was used in London Bridge. Granite from here was definitely used in Nelson's Column and Dartmoor Prison, however.</li>
      <li>The site was closed down in 1906, due to rival quarries at Haytor and  having better transport links to London. </li>
      <li>For more information on the geology of the area, see the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://variscancoast.co.uk/foggintor-quarry" target="_blank">Variscan Coast</a> website.</li>
      <li>The area is now a popular place to visit for climbers, walkers, cyclists and the odd wild swimmer.</li>
      <li>To walk there, you can approach from the North, at the car park grid reference 750568 on the B3357; from Princetown along the Granite Way cycle path, or from the South West, parking near Eggworthy, at 723550.</li>
